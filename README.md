# DSA-Practice
Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey through *Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)* using *Java*.  
I'm currently following the [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet]((https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)) to build a solid foundation in problem-solving and coding interview preparation.
